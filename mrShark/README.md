The main board is the mrShark controlling everything on the robot.
For programming you also need the programmer board. Optional you can use the debuger board to charge the robots batteries and use the serial debug interface to test the robot without infrared communication.


## What you need

* LED-Marker (vision detection marker) 
* mrShark Adapter (programming, debugging and charging)

Also consider using the LiPo-Charger-Multiboard for charging larger sets of robots.
