IR-Splitter
===========
Hardware to split IR data load to seperate MOSFET channels.
Connect power supply and IR data from IR-Transmitter to the board.
Voltage of power supply depends on you needs but test show that it should be between 5V and 12V (7.5V is recommended).

Connect IR-leds to the 10 IR-OUT pads. Try to balance the number of leds on the channels.
It's recommended to use a heatsink on the mosfets.

Test your installation with different intervals of load.
MOSFET's temperature should not be above 80Â°C!
